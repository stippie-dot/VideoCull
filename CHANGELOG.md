# Changelog

All notable changes to Video Cull will be documented here.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Bookmarks** — press B while playing to drop a bookmark at the current position. Bookmarks persist across sessions and appear as clickable chips below the player (click to seek, hover to reveal remove button). A count badge shows on the thumbnail strip when a video has bookmarks.
- **Playback speed controls** — `[` / `]` step through 0.5×, 0.75×, 1×, 1.25×, 1.5×, 2×. Speed is shown as an overlay badge and persists as you move between videos in the same session.
- **Keyboard shortcuts overlay** — press `?` anywhere to open a reference of all shortcuts.

### Fixed
- Rare crash (black screen / render process gone) that could occur while interacting with the video player during playback. Root cause: frequent React re-renders of the Video.js player stack triggered a native access violation in Chromium's media pipeline.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-01

Initial release.
